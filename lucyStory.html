          <p><em>Lady of the Manor</em></p>
          <h2>Story</h2>
          <p>
            Lucy reclines by the window, her luxurious fur catching the light
            just so, giving her an almost ethereal glow. She sits with an
            unmistakable air of dignity, her paws perfectly aligned, her head
            held high, and her gaze fixed on the world beyond. To her, this is
            more than a mere window—it's her throne, her vantage point from
            which she oversees her “kingdom.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Her sharp, intelligent eyes scan the backyard, noting every bird
            that flits by, every leaf that falls, and every slight movement in
            her domain. The world outside may seem ordinary to most, but to
            Lucy, it’s a tapestry of intrigue and elegance, worthy of her
            refined observation. She watches with the intensity of a true ruler,
            calm but fully aware, as if she’s assessing each detail and
            determining its place in her world.
          </p>
          <p>
            Occasionally, she’ll glance back, making sure you’re watching her
            too, as if to remind you that you’re in the presence of feline
            royalty. Her gaze, cool and composed, suggests that she expects
            nothing but admiration. And who could deny her? In this moment,
            she’s not just Lucy the cat—she’s the Lady of the Manor, the regal
            heart of the household, and she knows it.
