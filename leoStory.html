          <p><em>The Great Ambush</em></p>
          <h2>Story</h2>
          <p>
            Leo crouches low, just barely peeking over the edge of the couch,
            his eyes wide and focused. His little paws are tucked beneath him,
            his body as still as a statue, ready to spring into action at any
            moment. Today’s target? The fluffy blanket on the sofa, which to
            Leo, is no mere blanket—it’s a mysterious creature that needs to be
            “hunted.” He shifts slightly, his tail flicking back and forth as he
            calculates the perfect moment to pounce.
          </p>
          <p>
            In his mind, he’s a wild predator, stalking his prey in the thick of
            the jungle, his every muscle tensed and alert. The only thing that
            gives him away is the faint wiggle of his tail, betraying his
            excitement. Finally, he decides it’s time. With a mighty leap (as
            mighty as a tiny cat can manage), he springs forward, landing
            squarely on the blanket, grabbing it in his paws and rolling around
            with it in a flurry of playful “fury.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Leo’s ambush may be over in seconds, but in his mind, he’s a hero,
            victorious in his latest conquest. For now, he settles into the
            blanket, his new “prize,” thoroughly satisfied with his hunting
            prowess.
