          <p><em>Lost in a Daydream</em></p>
          <h2>Story</h2>
          <p>
            Bella sits by the window, her soft, graceful form silhouetted
            against the morning light. She gazes out into the distance, her eyes
            half-closed as if she’s lost somewhere between reality and a dream.
            What does she see? Maybe it’s the flutter of a bird’s wings, or the
            gentle sway of leaves in the breeze. But in Bella’s imagination,
            it’s more than that. Perhaps she envisions herself in a field of
            wildflowers, bathed in golden sunlight, where butterflies drift
            lazily and she moves as gracefully as a cloud.
          </p>
          <p>
            She ponders the mysteries of the world beyond the glass with the
            serene wisdom of a philosopher. Every now and then, her gaze softens
            even further, and she sighs softly, as if something in the distance
            speaks to her heart. For Bella, this window is more than just a
            piece of glass—it’s a portal to all the quiet, beautiful places she
            dreams of.
          </p>
          <p>
            As the minutes pass, Bella remains utterly still, as if afraid to
            break the spell of her daydream. In this moment, she’s not just a
            cat; she’s a poet, a dreamer, the queen of her own quiet universe,
            savoring the beauty of simply being.
